Why, `Hello World!`

This is my first ever blog post on my site! I hope those who read this will follow any work that I carry out.

The idea behind this blog / website is to document things that I do, such as learning Development, Penetration Testing, Bounty Hunting, Twitch / Streaming related stuff too.

A little about me..

I really enjoy developing and playing around with Software. I've been messing about in .NET or C# for around 4 years at the time of writing this. I've made several different types of servers for Grand Theft Auto V and the few multi-player clients related to this. Ranging from simple add on scripts for servers or being fully involved in the creation, planning and development of servers.

Outside of Development, I am a BEMS Controls Engineer & Refrigeration Engineer. I work in a small family business and have done so for a few years now. I've also put my development knowledge into work, making custom framework modules for work as well as custom graph / site logging programs to aid processing large amounts of data.

That's all for now! Don't forget to check out the Home Page for links on ways to follow & contact me!
