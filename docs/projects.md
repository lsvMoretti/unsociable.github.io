Projects
=========

I've got a list of any public projects and a brief description about the project.

[RatBot](https://github.com/lsvMoretti/RatBot)
----
RatBot is an open source Discord Bot that intergrates with Twitter. It includes a basic XP user levelling system, notifications of Twitter Posts and the ability to customise all this from commands inside discord. This project is my first in .NET 5, the new .NET standard. Future features include the ability to get notifications of YouTube creators, live chat from within YouTube and more!
